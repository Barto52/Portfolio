## About me
Hi! I am Bartek, a software tester with 2 years of commercial experience. I am highly focused on self-development and my prime goal is to become a Full Stack Tester. I consider myself as easily adaptable, ambitious and stubborn (but in a good way :D). I am also a fast learner. Currently, I am gaining knowledge and skills in automation testing (Playwright + TypeScript).
